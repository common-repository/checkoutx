== What do we do best? ==

The real success of our merchants comes when they combine our high-converting frictionless checkout with the powerful post-purchase upsells that customers see after they’ve completed their purchase.

**Online shopping made effortless.**
Checkout X multiplies your WooCommerce revenue by introducing a high-converting, mobile-first checkout with seamless & secure payments, well-timed post-purchase upsells, and a robust set of available integrations to add extra value.

**Less abandoned carts, more revenue.**
With the one-page checkout experience and minimum number of input fields, Checkout X solves one of the main reasons why customers abandon carts - long and confusing checkout process. By eliminating friction and distractions, customers can check out almost instantly.

**All you need under one roof.**
Forget about using multiple plugins to boost your WooCommerce store’s conversion rates or struggling with code to modify the design, layout, and behavior of your checkout. With Checkout X, you get a complete plug-and-play solution you set up once and forget about it.

== Increase conversion rates with a frictionless one-page checkout ==

- **[Fast checkout process](https://www.checkout-x.com/frictionless_checkout).** The industry average for most checkouts is about 66 seconds, while customers using Checkout X can finish in less than 25 seconds.
- **Less input fields for customers.** Eliminate all friction and distractions to reduce any chances customers can drop off due to a long and overwhelming checkout process.
- **One page checkout.** Instantly show customers the entire checkout and how easy it’s going to be to complete their order by showing all the fields and the simplified UI.
- **Auto-complete for customer info.** Give customers an even bigger speed boost by eliminating the need to input their address manually with location-based auto-fill.
- **Made for mobile.** Completing orders with Checkout X is fast and simple on any device to give your customers on the move a better shopping experience.
- **Buy Now links.** Help customers skip the cart and go straight to checkout with the product already there, ready to complete the order faster.
- **Abandoned cart emails.** Recover any revenue leaks by sending out personal email notifications that help shoppers pickup where they left from and complete their orders.

== Boost revenue and AOV with relevant & well-timed upsells ==

Post-purchase upsells can be effective in all E-commerce stores, whatever the industry. 3 out of 4 merchants who set up an upsell manage to get extra sales.

- **[Post-purchase upsells](https://www.checkout-x.com/post_purchase_upsells).** Trigger special offers for customers after they’ve entered their payment information and confirmed their order so it’s twice as easy to increase AOV without any additional actions.
- **A/B testing.** Run tests between multiple triggers and upsell offers to find the highest-converting combinations that provide the most value for customers and the most revenue for your WooCommerce store.

== Promote trust, confidence, and security to increase sales ==

- **[Impeccable payment security](https://www.checkout-x.com/seamless_payments).** With the tailored payment integrations, Checkout X brings the security of your payment provider and their additional features using their native API. All payment data is collected and processed directly by the payment provider and not stored within Checkout X.
- **3D Secure payments.** PSD2 compliant with 3D Secure payment support at no extra cost. To combine ease of use with security, 3D Secure is only invoked when required by the customer’s bank.
- **Fraud protection.** With 3D security, you get bank-level protection by eliminating fraud liability while shifting all of it to the customer’s bank, letting you focus on growth, instead of worrying about fraud.

== Connect and start selling in no time. No technical skills needed. ==
